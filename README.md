# Antares Retail Server

Antares Retail Server is MongoDB and Node.js-based retail application system designed for accessibility, scalability, and performance.

## Development

- [Used pandas](https://github.com/juliamcneill/antares-retail-server/tree/master/data) to transform large-scale SQL-based .csv data for import into a noSQL database.
- Structured [schemas](https://github.com/juliamcneill/antares-retail-server/blob/master/db/schemas.js) and [query logic](https://github.com/juliamcneill/antares-retail-server/blob/master/index.js) within Node.js and Express to optimize response times of mongoDB database.
- [Containerized services in Docker](https://github.com/juliamcneill/antares-retail-server/blob/master/docker-compose.yml), set up authentication, and deployed within an AWS EC2 instance.
